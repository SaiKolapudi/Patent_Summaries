# Example usage
abstract = "This patent describes a new method for detecting and treating cancer in humans. The method involves using a combination of nanoparticles and gene therapy to target cancer cells and deliver therapeutic agents directly to the tumor site. The nanoparticles are coated with specific ligands that can bind to cancer cells, allowing for targeted drug delivery. In addition, the gene therapy component involves introducing genetic material that can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and enhance the immune response. The combination of these approaches results in a more effective and precise treatment for cancer patients."
